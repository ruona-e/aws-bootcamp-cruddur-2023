# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

I attempted all of the assignments and I ran into a challenge with my gitpod. You when you click on the gitpod button from your github and it takes you to the VS code editor in your local machine, mine refused to connect. Rather it opens up the online vs editor which I used to set up my AWS CLI. However, I haven't been able to resolve the issue yet.
